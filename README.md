# Advent of Code 2019 (JS/TS)
This year in the hope to complete AoC once with JS/TS to focus on the problems in instead of fiddling around with Elixir, Rust or Haskel like in the past three years.

I enjoy the stars after each day. So no code golfing or refactoring, just the pure and immature code that poured out of my brain early morning.

This is a yarn workspace to share node_modules through a proper package hoisting.

```
# in the root, will install all packages for all days
yarn install

# start any day like this
yarn workspace 2019-06 start

# check the console output in the browser
```
